We should not paraphrase as that \r\n    can potentially distort things. If somethings need to be done differently in the ASPA context\r\n    in comparison to what has been stated in another RFC related to, say, ROA (as an example),\r\n    then we need to state that and state our reasons clearly.\r\n    Also, I think we need not state that we'll use MFTs, etc. even if they are stale.\r\n    The expiry time is 2 to 3 days out and the RPKI repository outage will rarely last more \r\n    than a few to several hours.

However, these are exactly the questions that SIDROPs was most concerned with. Implementations that neglect careful and thoughtful treatment of these black swan events cause significant disruptions when these events inevitably happen.\r\n\r\nSo I agree that we need not paraphrase details of RFC 9286 (although summarizing its overall behavior/purpose is a good style so the reader knows what they can find in RFC 9286). But we should highlight details that are not obvious from RFC 9286 and maybe extend beyond what RFC 9286 deals with (using expired objects when cache refreshes keep failing, and ignoring the objects is likely to result in an incident), when this is important to make applications robust against highly unlikely events.",
