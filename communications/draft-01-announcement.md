Hi all,

We (the authors) had presented this draft at the IETF 114 SIDROPS meeting in Philly.
Thanks for the discussion and comments we received at the mike and during individual conversations (especially from Ben and Job).
We have addressed several those comments in the updated version -01 draft which is available here:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-sriram-sidrops-bar-sav-01
 
In particular, we have added a new Section 6 with these topic areas: 

6.  Operations and Management Considerations</br>
  6.1.  Applicability of ASPA and ROA</br>
  6.2.  BAR-SAV and Routing Policy</br>
  6.3.  Where to Deploy BAR-SAV</br>
  6.4.  Automation is the Key</br>
  6.5. Implementation Guidelines</br>
    6.5.1. Management of Local RPKI Repository Caches</br>
    6.5.2. Management of Objects Temporarily Missing from RPKI Repositories

Please let us know your thoughts on whether the above additions (Sections) seem to adequately address your questions. We are open to any further suggestions.

Thank you.

Igor / Sriram / Doug
